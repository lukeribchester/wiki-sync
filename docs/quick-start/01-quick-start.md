# Quick Start

Welcome to the **quick start** guide for engineering at Rosa!

The spirit of this guide is to provide you with the minimal amount of information necessary for you
to take a small task from zero to production.

You’ll be guided through each step of the journey to production with just enough context about the
relevant terminology, applications, and processes. The goal is for you to celebrate your first pull
request with a foundational understanding of what you’ll be working on.
